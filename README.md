Arduino IDE + NodeMCU ESP8266 + P10 LED Panel | NodeMCU ESP8266 controls P10 LED Panel using Arduino IDE (including text set in P10 with Web Server). In this project video I use Arduino IDE 1.8.9 , Notepad++ V7.7.1 , NodeMCU ESP8266 V3 and P10 LED Panel.

Download the DMDESP Library by busel7 (Bonny Useful) : https://github.com/busel7/DMDESP

Note :
The drawback of this library (DMDESP) is that there is a slight flicker in the Text display that doesn't move (doesn't scroll). But in my opinion it's still good. Flicker does not occur on the scrolling text.

The code file is saved in the .rar file format. I created a .rar file using Winrar V5.50, so to extract it, make sure you use the same version of Winrar that I use or the latest version or use the winrar extractor online.

Sorry if my English is confusing, I use an online translator.
